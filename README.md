## Introduction to the project

The Moon Must Be Ours is a game I developed as technical assessment for Outfit7's recruitment process. The repository stores the Unity project, including all the content created by me, as well as all its dependencies it relies on in order to help streamline the review process.

**Development time:** 10 days

## Pitch

It is 2021. You, Alon Must, are the leader of the 21st Century space race. To ratify this position, there is still one objective to complete: reaching the Moon for the first time in the last 50 years. You have invested everything on this quest and success is guaranteed, but you are not the only participant in this competition...

## Assessment requirements

The minimum requirements for this assessment were:

- **Spaceship:** The element under player’s control. Among its main features are: motion based on player’s input, automatic shooting and upgrade by power-up pickup. It can be damaged by enemy shot and enemy or obstacle collision.

- **Enemies with behaviours (paths, formations):** There are two types of enemy in the game. Vans and Destructors. Vans spawn in groups of four and follow a circular pattern. They drop boxes as their projectiles. Destructors, on their part, appear in groups of three, in V formation and with a linear movement. They shoot smiles. Both can be damaged by player’s rockets.
